### TANK MATES

***

### ***DEPLOYED PROJECT:***

The project can be played and viewed [here](https://tank-mates-app.herokuapp.com/).

***

### ***DESCRIPTION***

Tank Mates was developed with the objective of creating a collection of saltwater fish in which users can add to their online tank. All users are able to go into the fish store and select from a vast variety of saltwater creatures. Users will be able to view their current tank and make changes as needed whether it is by adding fish, giving fish away, or marking fish aggression levels.

Users are able to go on to a message board in which they can post their thoughts, ask questions to other fish tank enthusiasts, and/or submit replies. Each user receives a bio in which they can add to or modify.
